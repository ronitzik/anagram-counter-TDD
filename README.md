# TDD Intro Project - Count Anagrams

## Overview
This is a simple project to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD). The goal of the project is to implement a function that counts how many times an anagram of a given word appears in a larger text. 

## What I've Done
- **Implemented the `count_anagrams` function**: The function scans the text to find all substrings that are anagrams of the given word.
- **Created unit tests**: I wrote tests to ensure the correctness of the function, including edge cases and performance testing with large texts.
- **Optimized the function**: Initially, the function was inefficient. I improved it by using a sliding window technique to speed up the performance.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: I followed the TDD approach, writing tests first and then implementing the code, ensuring it passed all tests at each step.
